*** Bodega
**** edit provider??
**** print stock list

* highligth family icon when selected

* translations
  * Default use: load some tranlation files and LANG system env turns out to be the language to be shown
  * We will have language switch control -> change language dynamically
  * installTranslator() will create a change event which will be sent to every single widget
  * Maybe in Ipartner???

void MyWidget::changeEvent(QEvent* event)
{
    if (event->type() == QEvent::LanguageChange)
    {
        // retranslate designer form
        ui.retranslateUi(this);

       // retranslate other widgets which weren't added in designer
       // all tr("") in the same function to be called every time language is changed
       retranslate();
   }

   // remember to call base class implementation
   QWidget::changeEvent(event);
   // or QMainWindow::changeEvent(event);
}
